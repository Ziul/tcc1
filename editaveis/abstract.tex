   This paper presents a study of alternatives for better presentation of search results to repositories and packages managers present in Linux distributions in order to sort the most interesting results to the user based on the values of input and inclusion of consideration of input contains errors spelling, either through ignorance of the name of the package, either by casual misspellings. To aid in the study, we used string matching algorithms for sorting candidates and include the possibility of typos.
